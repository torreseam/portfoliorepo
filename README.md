CONTENTS OF THIS FILE
---------------------

 * Introduction

 Overview
The pages contained within this directory comprise a template we've created for faculty home pages. If you wish to supplement your information as it exists on the main departmental webpage with additional materials, we would like to offer the use of this template for the layout.

 * Content

 Images
The images, in particular the left navigation "rollover" buttons, were created with Macromedia Fireworks 3.0. If you require additional buttons, you can ask me to create them or create additional ones using the Fireworks source file (left_buttons.png) provided in the template/leftbuttons directory. Fireworks makes it very easy to create and modify "rollover" buttons. Images other than buttons, may be created with virtually any software.
